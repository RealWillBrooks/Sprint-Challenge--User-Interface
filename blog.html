                    <p>About a year ago, I began my quest to learn to code. Not being exactly sure where to start, I found myself doing what everybody does now a days, Googling “How to code” on Google and came across many different answers.

                            Many of the top results were websites that offered free and paid courses to teach individuals how to code.
                            
                            Meaning you don’t even need to spend a ton of money or put yourself in debt to learn how to code now a days.
                            
                            That being said here are six of the top websites to learn how to code for free:</p>

                    <p>Blogging was not just something that I stumbled across and started doing. When it came down to blogging, it was a matter of when I wanted to start and what did I want to blog about. When blogging you’ll always find yourself pondering questions such as, “am I wasting my time,” or “is anybody even going to read this crap?”

                            Well, throw those two questions out of your head right now.
                            
                            Blogging should be stress free, after all it’s done mostly in the comfort of your own home whenever you have some “me” time. Worrying over those questions would just add stress and strain to some.
                            
                            Another stress can be over what you may be blogging about, but believe it or not many people use blogs to do any of the following:</p>
